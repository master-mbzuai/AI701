## Project description

## Project structure

- pretrained architecture -> report the baseline data with the pretrained weights and pretrained classifier
- original classifier -> fine tune the classifier given the pretrained weights, the classifier is the original, but has to be retrained to fit the new dataset and provide realistic performance with different epochs training
- adaptive classifier -> fine tune the first modification of the classifier, the classifier is now two levels deep and it does not have any non-linearity
- nmf adaptive classifier -> fine tune the second modification of the classifier, the classifier is now two levels deep and it does have non-linearity (at the beginning and at the beginning)
- hierarchy classifier -> fancier stuff with the most interesting results (hopefully)

## How to run

I still don't know
